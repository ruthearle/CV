I am a junior full-stack web developer based in London. After completing a three month immersive Makers Academy web development course (August 2014 cohort) I feel ready to start my journey into creating great software.


My professional background is in healthcare and I have also owned and operated a franchise business, which was not too dissimilar to remote working, only with more responsibility. However, since 2010 I have been a full-time stay at home mother of two children.

Web Development
----

I was draw to coding because it fascinated me and I found that everytime
I picked up my Mac to play around with creating a website I lost hours
but felt invigorated and challenged. After many years of 'tinkering'
I decided to make it happen and as though by magic I found Makers
Academy.
