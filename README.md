I am a junior full-stack web developer based in London. After completing a three month immersive Makers Academy web development course (August 2014 cohort) I feel ready to start my journey into creating great software.

Code Examples
----

> [Fhellow]

Week ten final project at Makers Academy completed by myself and three other team members. Historically final projects were based on suggestions from students and staff. Fhellow was the first project that was pitched by a client. Hosted on Heroku: [Fhellow](http://fhellow.herokuapp.com/)

Week five weekend challenge to make an online version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. This app was fully test-driven and built using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. Hosted on Heroku: [RPSLS](https://rockpaperscissorslizardspockjs.herokuapp.com/)

> [Take Away]

Week four weekend challenge. This was a Ruby project completed after learning about SOLID principled object-orientated design, therefore I focused on single responsibility by creating many classes based on their responsibilities.

Web Development
----

I was draw to coding because it fascinated me and I found that everytime
I picked up my Mac to play around with creating a website I lost hours
but felt invigorated and challenged. After many years of 'tinkering'
I decided to make it happen and as though by magic I found Makers
Academy.
